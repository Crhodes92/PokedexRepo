# PokedexRepo

https://crhodes92.github.io/PokedexRepo/

  With this project you'll have the power of Ash Ketchum's original pokedex right at your fingertips! This was a passion project that was based on our groups love of pokemon. One issue we saw growing up was that there wasn't ever one comprehensive source for all the information you'd need to be the very best. We utilized the PokeApi and Google's custom search api to bridge that gap. Firebase keeps track of how many you've caught while you tick off the numbers and become the ultimate pokemon master. Rather than use Bootstrap like every other project out there we tried a different CSS framework called materialize.
